                <p class="text">The coins rust and expand to three times their original thickness, corroding and fracturing the world heritage site, the National Trust, which manages the site, said on Wednesday.</p>
                <p class="text">They appealed to the public to end the tradition that has left coins from all over the world embedded in the County Antrim landmark. “We are urging people to stop the practice and to leave no trace so this natural wonder remains special for future generations,” said Cliff Henry, a National Trust nature engagement officer.</p>
